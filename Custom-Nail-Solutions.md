The majority of this repository is code in other languages which we are not using. 
Most, if not all, of the processing is done using code within the "wrapper/python" 
folder available in this repository. Within that foler, traverse to "examples" and
there will be pre-written code from the library and 2 scripts which have been
created/modified by Reynaldo.
